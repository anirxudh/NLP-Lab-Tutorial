## Introduction to NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of:

- Python programming
- Basic machine learning concepts
- Some familiarity with libraries like Numpy and Pandas

## Installation

To run the examples provided in this tutorial, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- NLTK
- Spacy
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim
- TensorFlow or PyTorch

You can install these libraries using pip:

python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

## Fundamental Concepts

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller pieces, called tokens. These tokens can be words, sentences, or subwords. Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP as it prepares the text for further processing.

**Example:**

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```
### Stop Words

Stop words are common words (such as "the", "is", "in") that are often removed from text before processing because they do not carry significant meaning.

**Example**

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print(filtered_tokens)
```
### Stemming and Lemmatization
Stemming and Lemmatization are techniques used to reduce words to their root form. Stemming removes suffixes from words, while Lemmatization uses a dictionary to find the base form.

**Example:**

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

stemmed = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_tokens]
lemmatized = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_tokens]

print(stemmed)
print(lemmatized)
```
### Bag of Words
The Bag of Words (BoW) model represents text as a collection of words and their frequencies. It ignores grammar and word order but considers multiplicity.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = ["Natural Language Processing is fascinating.",
          "Language Processing is essential for AI."]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```
### TF-IDF
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

**Example:**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print(tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X_tfidf.toarray())
```
## Advanced Topics

### Word Embeddings
Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their meanings, semantic relationships, and context.

**Example with Gensim:**
```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

sentences = [["natural", "language", "processing", "is", "fascinating"],
             ["language", "processing", "is", "essential", "for", "AI"]]
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=50, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

print(model.wv['language'])
```
### Sequence Models
Sequence models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used for tasks involving sequential data like text.

### Attention Mechanisms
Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when making predictions, improving performance on tasks like translation and summarization.
